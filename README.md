# ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ Chilean Fires Analysis ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥

In this project I analyze data from [NASA's FIRMS](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/firms) to understand which places have the most likelihood to catch on fire.

**Done:**
- Generate clusters of fires grouped by time.
- Generate MBR out of clusters.

**TODO:**

- Measure intersection of clusters of fires in time.
- Get areas with the most likelihood of fire.
- Understand how climate variables (from Meteochile) affect the number of fires.
- Build a forecasting model for the number of fires based on climate variables.
