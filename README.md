In this project I analyze data from [NASA's FIRMS](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/firms) to understand which places have the most likelihood to catch on fire.

## Done
- Generate clusters of fires grouped by time.

- Generate MBR out of clusters.

- Measure intersection of MBR of fire clusters in time.

- Dashboard to visualize fires.

## TODO

- Understand how climate variables (from Meteochile) affect the number of fires.
- Build a forecasting model for the number of fires based on climate variables.
- Get areas with the most likelihood of fire.
- Plot areas with the highest likelihood of fires in the Dashboard.
